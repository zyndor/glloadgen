    <title>Style No Load</title>
    <para>The <literal>noload_cpp</literal> style works a lot like the near-defunct GLee loader. You
        don't need to call a function to load all of the function pointers; instead, you simply call
        the GL functions as normal. If it hasn't been loaded, it will be. This makes it among the
        most user-friendly of the loader styles.</para>
    <para>As a C++ style, it follows the naming conventions of the <link><literal
                xlink:href="Style_Pointer_CPP">pointer_cpp</literal></link> style. Everything is
        scoped into namespaces. The enumerators don't have the <literal>GL_</literal> prefix on
        them, and so forth.</para>
    <para>The main difference is this. <literal>noload_cpp</literal> does have a system function
        called <literal>sys::CheckExtensions</literal>. This function walks through the list of
        advertised extensions and sets up the extension variables. It does not load anything, so
        there is no way to tell if all of the function pointers that are advertised are actually
        available.</para>
