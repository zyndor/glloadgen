    <title>Extension Files</title>
    <para>The extension file format is pretty simple, but it does have quite a bit of power to
        it.</para>
    <para>Every line of the file is expected to be one of the following:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Nothing. An empty line, spaces, anything that isn't visible text.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>A <literal>#include ""</literal> statement. This will cause the loading of another
                extension file named in the <literal>""</literal>s. The <emphasis>current file's
                    location</emphasis> will be the base directory for any relative paths. So if you
                do <literal>#include "more.txt"</literal>, it will search for
                    <filename>more.txt</filename> in the same directory as this extension
                file.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>A <literal>#include &lt;></literal> statement. This will cause the loading of
                another extension file named in the <literal>&lt;></literal>s. The location of the
                glLoadGen will be used for the base directory of any relative paths. This is mostly
                intended to allow easy inclusion of the standard extension files, located in the
                    <filename>extfiles</filename> directory. Therefore, </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Anything starting with <literal>//</literal> will be ignored as a comment.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Anything starting with <literal>--</literal> will be ignored as a comment.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Any other text in a line will be interpreted as an extension name. Extension names
                should not have the <quote>GL_</quote>/<quote>WGL_</quote>/<quote>GLX_</quote>
                prefixes.</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The inclusion mechanism is quite powerful.</para>
