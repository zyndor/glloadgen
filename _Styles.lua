--[[This module is the interface to all of the style-based code generation facilities.

The module has a function called GetStyleList, which returns a list of all available styles.

This module has a function called GetStyle, which is given a style name. It will return a table of functions that can be evaluated to do different code generation tasks. This table contains:


- WriteLargeHeading(hFile, headingName)
--		Writes a comment heading to the file. A large one.

- WriteSmallHeading(hFile, headingName)
--		Writes a comment heading to the file. A small one.



- header.CreateFile(basename, options)
--		basename is the filename sans extension. It opens a TabbedFile from it, using the options in options. It returns two values: a TabbedFile, and the actual filename used.

- header.MakeIncludeGuard(prefix, specIncl)
--		specIncl is an include-guard string from the spec. It returns a string that includes the two strings, which is appropriate for use as an include-guard.

- header.WriteStdTypedefs(hFile, specData, spec, options)
--		Writes the standard typedefs.

- header.WriteSpecTypedefs(hFile, specData, spec, options)
--		Writes the typedefs from the spec. The "funcData.passthru" section.

- header.WriteBeginDecl(hFile, spec, options)
--		Writes any style-specific scoping stuff that begins the declaration section. This is useful for things like 'extern "C"' and so forth.
--	

- header.WriteEndDecl(hFile, spec, options)
--		Writes any style-specific scoping stuff that ends the declaration section. This is useful for things like 'extern "C"' and so forth.

- header.WriteExtVariableDecl(hFile, extName, specData, spec, options)
--		Writes the variable declaration for a single extension variable. These are the variables that are exposed so that the user can test to see if an extension loaded.

- header.WriteBeginEnumDeclBlock(hFile, spec, options)
--		Writes any style-specific scoping stuff that starts the enumerator block. This is for *all* enumerators. This is useful for wrapping all enumerators in an enum declaration.

- header.WriteEndEnumDeclBlock(hFile, spec, options)
--		Writes any style-specific scoping stuff that ends the enumerator block.

- header.WriteEnumDecl(hFile, enum, enumTable, spec, options)
--		Writes an enumerator.

- header.WriteEnumPrevDecl(hFile, enum, enumTable, spec, options, extName)
--		Writes an enumerator that was written previously. Should be written as a comment, as it could conflict. extName is the name of the extension where it was originally written.

- header.WriteBeginFuncDeclBlock(hFile, spec, options)
--	Write any style-specific scoping stuff that starts the function declaration block.

- header.WriteEndFuncDeclBlock(hFile, spec, options)
--	Write any style-specific scoping stuff that ends the function declaration block.

- header.WriteBeginExtFuncDeclBlock(hFile, extName, spec, options)
-- Used for starting the declarations for a partiuclar extension.

- header.WriteEndExtFuncDeclBlock(hFile, extName, spec, options)
-- Used for ending the declarations for a partiuclar extension.

- header.WriteFuncDecl(hFile, func, typemap, spec, options)
--	Writes a function declaration. This can include multiple statements, such as a typedef, an extern function pointer declaration, and a #define or whatever.

- header.WriteStatusCodeDecl(hFile, spec, options)
--	Writes any declarations for status codes as returned from the loader and so forth.

- header.WriteMainLoaderFuncDecl(hFile, spec, options)
--	Writes the declaration for the main loading function.

- header.WriteVersioningFuncDecls(hFile, spec, options)
--	Writes the declarations for any functions used to help the user get versioning info. Will only be called if the spec has versions.


- source.CreateFile(basename, options)
--		basename is the filename sans extension. It opens a TabbedFile from it, using the options in options. It returns two values: a TabbedFile, and the actual filename used.

- source.WriteIncludes(hFile, spec, options)
--	Writes the include files for standard library stuff.

- source.WriteBeginDef(hFile, spec, options)
--	Writes any scoping for the block of definitions.

- source.WriteEndDef(hFile, spec, options)
--	Ends any scoping for the block of definitions.

- source.WriteExtVariableDef(hFile, ext, specData, spec, options)
--	Writes the extension variable definition for `ext`.

- source.WriteBeginExtFuncDefBlock(hFile, extName, spec, options)
--	Writes the beginning of an extension's block that contains function pointer definitions and the loader function for this extension.

- source.WriteEndExtFuncDefBlock(hFile, extName, spec, options)
--	Writes the ending of an extension's block that contains function pointer definitions and the loader function for this extension.

- source.WriteFuncDef(hFile, func, typemap, spec, options)
--	Writes a function pointer definition for the given function.

- source.WriteBeginExtLoaderBlock(hFile, extName, spec, options)
--	Writes the beginning of an extension loader function.

- source.WriteEndExtLoaderBlock(hFile, extName, spec, options)
--	Writes the ending of an extension loader function.

- source.WriteExtFuncLoader(hFile, func, typemap, spec, options)
--	Writes the code that goes inside an extension loader function that loads and tests a single extension function pointer.

- source.WriteBeginCoreFuncDefBlock(hFile, version, spec, options)
--	Writes the beginning of the core loader's block that contains function pointer definitions and the loader function for `version`.

- source.WriteEndCoreFuncDefBlock(hFile, version, spec, options)
--	Writes the end of the core loader's block that contains function pointer definitions and the loader function for `version`.

- source.WriteBeginCoreLoaderBlock(hFile, version, spec, options)
--	Writes the start of the actual function that loads the function pointers for `version`.

- source.WriteEndCoreLoaderBlock(hFile, version, spec, options)
--	Writes the end of the actual function that loads the function pointers for `version`.

- source.WriteCoreFuncLoader(hFile, func, typemap, spec, options)
--	Writes the code that goes inside the core loader function that loads and tests a single extension function pointer.

- source.WriteUtilityDefs(hFile, specData, spec, options)
--	A place for writing utilities that will be needed by the function loader code. This can be a mapping table for mapping from extension name to loader funcs and extension variables or whatever you need to do the loading.

- source.WriteMainLoaderFunc(hFile, specData, spec, options)
--	Writes the implementation of the main loader function.

- source.WriteVersioningFuncs(hFile, specData, spec, options)
--	Writes the implementation of any versioning functions.



If you want to extend this to new styles, then add a module for your style, import it, and register it's module table with the registry. Your module should export a function `Create` which takes no parameters and returns a table as defined above.
